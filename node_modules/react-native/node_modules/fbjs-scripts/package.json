Previously these were shipped as a part of `fbjs`.\n\n```js\n// before (fbjs@0.1.0)\nvar invariant = require('fbjs/lib/invariant');\nvar devExpression = require('fbjs/scripts/babel/dev-expression');\n\n// after (fbjs, fbjs-scripts@0.2.0)\nvar invariant = require('fbjs/lib/invariant');\nvar devExpression = require('fbjs-scripts/babel/dev-expression');\n```\n\n## Why?\n\nThis ensures that production code consuming `fbjs` library code does not need to install script dependencies, unless you explicitly use them via the `fbjs-scripts` package.\n",
